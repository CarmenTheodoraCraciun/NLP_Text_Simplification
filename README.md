# **NLP Text Simplification Using T5 Transformers**

## **Project Overview**
- This project focuses on developing an automatic text simplification system using Transformer-based models from the T5 family.

- The goal is to generate clearer and more understandable sentences while preserving the original meaning.

- The performance of the models has been evaluated using relevant metrics: SARI, BLEU, and ROUGE.

### **Tested Models**
The following four models have been tested:

ðŸ”¹ `t5-small`

ðŸ”¹ `flan-t5-small`

ðŸ”¹ `flan-t5-base`

ðŸ”¹ `flan-t5-large`

The initial tests were conducted using smaller models for quick experimentation. Gradually, more powerful versions were explored to improve overall performance.
